1 Introduction
 Scope
The purpose of this document is to provide the information and framework required to plan and develop the activities of the social security number validation algorithm testing process.
Context of Tests
Test Items
The following items will be tested:
- Module: Social Security Number Validation.
Scope of the Test
The system composed of the modules mentioned in section 2.2
Non-functional quality factors such as performance, IT security, and usability will not be tested in this test project.
Assumptions and Restrictions
Assumptions:
- The test environment will be a clone of the production environment so that new social security numbers can be calculated based on real cases.
 

Test Strategy
 Testing processes
Testing for the Social Security Number Validation System will include the following test threads:
● End-to-end tests
● Unit tests (white box)
 Test Deliverables
For each test process, the following documentation must be generated:
● Specification of Test Cases
● Test Process Completion Report.
Test Design Techniques
This section will identify the techniques that will be used for the design of the tests.
● Test cases
Completion Criteria and Test
Testing must achieve 90% coverage of requirements and all test procedures must run without Severity 1 (high) failures.
 Metrics
The following metrics will be collected during test execution:
● Number of test cases executed.
● Number of incidents by category.
● Number of resolved incidents by category.
 Test environment requirements
Testing environment

Operating systems	Windows

 Testing Tools

Manually testing

Suspension and resumption criteria
Suspension criteria

● One of the major features contains a bug that prevents critical areas of the system from being tested.
● The testing environment is not stable and/or does not return reliable results.

.
 Activities and test estimates
The tests will be divided into the following main activities:

1. Detailed specification of test cases.
2. First test execution cycle.
3. Test completion report.

Test Cases

Test Case ID,	Test Case Description,	Test Steps,	Test Data	Expected Result
T01	Insert zeros in program input	1. Run the program. 2. Enter “000-00-0000” in console. 3. Hit Enter	input = 000-00-0000	False
T02	Insert 666 in the first part of the SSN in program input	1. Run the program. 2. Enter “666” in console. 3. Hit Enter	input = 666-23-9283	False
T03	Insert “990” in the first par of the SSN in program input	1. Run the program. 2. Enter “990” in console. 3. Hit Enter	input = 990-23-9283	False
T04	Insert 2 digits in the last part of the SSN in program input	1. Run the program. 2. Enter “321-23-82 in console. 3. Hit Enter	input = 321-23-82	False
T05	Insert 4 digits in the middle part of the SSN in the program input	1. Run the program. 2. Enter “321-2893-4321 in console. 3. Hit Enter	input = 321-2893-4321	 False
TU06	Insert a valid SSN number in the program input	1. Run the program. 2. Write “219-28-8392” 3. Hit Enter	input = 219-28-8392	True
TU07	Insert letters in the program input	1. Run the program. 2. Write “n49-0e-98er” 3. Hit Enter	input = n49-0e-98er	False
TU08	Insert a valid SSN number in the program input	1. Run the program. 2. Write “456-983-1294” in console 3. Hit Enter	input = 456-98-1294	True
